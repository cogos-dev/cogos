// Package vitalsretention implements RFC-040 S2: the node-vitals retention
// provider.
//
// The kernel's autonomic ticker already emits a KernelHealthSnapshot every
// tick onto bus_kernel_proprio (internal/engine/autonomic_ticker.go,
// event type "kernel.health.snapshot.v1") — but that stream evaporates: the
// bus rotates events.jsonl to a timestamped archive at 64MB
// (internal/engine/bus_session.go) and the only read path,
// BusSessionManager.ReadEvents, scans the current file only. RFC-040 Open
// Question 1 established that raw bytes likely survive rotation but the
// query path does not — so S2 must be a RECORDER, not a compactor sitting
// over the bus. This package is that recorder.
//
// Design summary (see RFC-040 §"S2 — Retention provider" for the full spec):
//
//   - Recorder subscribes to bus_kernel_proprio via
//     BusSessionManager.AddEventHandler (wired in
//     internal/providers/all/all.go's engine.WireProviderRuntime hook,
//     which runs after the live bus manager exists — see ADR-085's
//     leaf-package discipline: this package never imports internal/engine).
//   - Every snapshot decomposes into named metrics (host vitals + provider
//     health counts + anomalies), each appended as one NDJSON line to
//     .cog/observatory/vitals/<node_key>/raw/<metric>/<YYYY-MM-DD>.ndjson.
//   - Compaction downsamples raw->5m after 48h and 5m->1h after 30d,
//     pruning the finer tier once its coarser replacement is written (N3).
//   - The only query surface is Window(metric, since, resolution) — no DSL
//     (N2). Exposed over GET /v1/vitals and a cog_ MCP tool by
//     internal/engine (see serve_vitals.go / mcp_tool_vitals.go there).
//   - File naming keys on node identity behind the NodeKeySource seam
//     (nodekey.go) — the concrete node_id is being reconciled in cogos
//     PR #474 (Seam B); this package does not depend on or block on it.
//
// This provider registers with pkg/substrate/reconcile as "vitals-retention"
// so its Health() folds into the kernel's proprioception snapshot like any
// other provider — but it manages no external declared-vs-live resource, so
// LoadConfig/FetchLive/ComputePlan/ApplyPlan/BuildState are honest no-ops in
// the same "stubMethods" idiom internal/providers/daemon/daemon.go already
// uses for agent/discord/eval/identity/mcp-tools/etc.: Health() is the only
// meaningful axis for a provider whose job is "keep recording," not
// "reconcile declared state."

// before Health() reports Degraded.

// Sizing: the recorder is driven by the autonomic ticker's
// bus_kernel_proprio dispatch (see recorder.go), which fires on the order of
// once per minute. 15 minutes is therefore many missed ticks — comfortably
// past transient scheduling jitter, a slow compaction pass, or a single
// dropped event, while still catching a genuine stall the same hour it
// starts rather than the next time a human happens to look.
//
// Deliberately NOT derived from the tick interval: this package is a leaf
// (ADR-085) and does not import internal/engine, and a monitor whose
// threshold silently follows the thing it monitors can be widened into
// uselessness by an unrelated config change.
const staleThreshold = 15 * time.Minute

// processStart is the fallback boot stamp for a Recorder that was created
// without one (the zero value). See Recorder.startedAt for why the grace
// period is per-instance rather than package-global.
var processStart = time.Now()

// Recorder is the live retention engine: it appends bus_kernel_proprio
// snapshots to per-metric-day NDJSON files and runs compaction/budget
// enforcement opportunistically on the same cadence (no new loop or daemon —
// RFC-040's "the ticker IS the scrape loop" doctrine, extended to S2: the
// bus-handler dispatch that already fires once per tick is the compaction
// cadence too).

	// lastAppendOKAt is the time of the most recent SUCCESSFUL append.
	//
	// Distinct from lastAppendAt, which is stamped on every append attempt
	// including failures. Health() needs the success timestamp because the
	// failure this field exists to catch is not "appends are erroring" but
	// "appends have STOPPED HAPPENING AT ALL" — the handler no longer being
	// invoked, or being invoked and silently recording nothing.
	//
	// Found live 2026-08-27: this recorder reported Healthy in the kernel
	// snapshot while its newest on-disk row was 17 hours old. Health() only
	// checked lastAppendErr, so a recorder that simply stopped writing was
	// indistinguishable from one working perfectly. That is precisely the
	// "monitor proven only by silence" failure this workspace treats as a
	// defect class: absence of an error is not evidence of liveness.

	// to package init time. A test — or a future multi-node/multi-recorder
	// arrangement — that constructs a fresh Recorder after the package has
	// been loaded for a while would see it born already "stale", which is
	// wrong and confusing. Zero value falls back to processStart via
	// bootStamp() so existing construction sites need no change.

	// goroutine is running for this recorder. Read and written only under

	// check-then-act race on lastCompactAt flagged non-blocking in #493's

	// time.Now() itself — see #500: maybeCompact's goroutine computing
	// excludeDay from wall-clock at its own (possibly delayed) run time
	// could disagree with the day appendRow actually wrote to, narrowly
	// reopening the read-then-delete race #498 closed. Keying off the same
	// time source appendRow uses removes that independent clock read
	// entirely, for any recorder that has processed at least one event.
	lastEventDay time.Time

	// compactWG counts in-flight compaction goroutines spawned by
	// maybeCompact (Add(1) before the `go func`, Done() via defer inside
