// serve_cors.go — permissive CORS middleware for the kernel HTTP server.
//
// Rationale (Wave 5a, 2026-04-23):
//
// The browser-served dashboard (mod3 at http://localhost:7860) calls the
// kernel at http://127.0.0.1:6931 to register a channel-session via
// /v1/channel-sessions/register. Cross-origin POSTs from the dashboard
// trigger a CORS preflight (OPTIONS) that the kernel previously rejected —
// no Access-Control-* headers were emitted, the browser blocked the
// request, and the dashboard fell back to calling mod3 directly. That
// fallback works but leaves an ugly console error and defeats the point of
// kernel authority over session_id minting.
//
// This middleware wraps the entire mux. It:
//
//   - Short-circuits OPTIONS preflight with 204 No Content + the required
//     Access-Control-* headers.
//   - On every response, sets Access-Control-Allow-Origin based on the
//     request Origin header (echo for loopback origins, otherwise "*").
//   - Declares a permissive method/header set sufficient for the mod3
//     dashboard, MCP /mcp endpoint, and anything else currently calling
//     the kernel. Include Mcp-Session-Id because the MCP streamable-HTTP
//     transport relies on it.
//
// Policy choice — echo-for-loopback with star fallback:
//
// The kernel binds 127.0.0.1:6931 by default (loopback-only), so
// Allow-Origin: * is not a security boundary — any local process can hit
// the socket regardless. But echoing the Origin header when it matches
// a loopback scheme (http://localhost:* or http://127.0.0.1:*) is friendly
// to credentialed requests (if Allow-Origin is "*" the browser refuses to
// send cookies). Future auth layers may want that, so we do the echo now.
// For non-loopback origins we fall back to "*" so the middleware stays
// compatible with pod / Tailnet deployments when cfg.BindAddr widens.
//
// Request whose Origin header is missing (same-origin fetches, curl, the
// MCP CLI, etc.) are untouched — the middleware only adds headers when an
// Origin is present or the method is OPTIONS.
//
// Exclusion — debug surfaces never get CORS headers, full stop:
//
// #505/#507 found that echoing Access-Control-Allow-Origin on the pprof +
// expvar surface under /debug/ (mounted in serve_debug.go) is itself part of
// the exposure: a malicious page's cross-origin fetch() is normally blocked
// by the browser's own same-origin policy on the *response*, but an
// Allow-Origin header (even "*") is the server explicitly waiving that
// protection and letting the page read the response body — e.g. a full heap
// dump. debugLoopbackOnly (serve_debug.go) is /debug/'s own auth layer and
// deliberately does not want ANY CORS header on its responses, ever,
// regardless of Origin. So /debug/ requests are excluded from this
// middleware entirely before any Origin/header logic runs.
//
// #507's review then caught that the same read primitive applied unchanged to
// the pre-existing /v1/debug/ endpoints (serve.go, handlers in debug.go):
// /v1/debug/last returns a DebugSnapshot carrying the extracted query text of
// the most recent chat request plus the filesystem paths of every injected
// cogdoc, and /v1/debug/context returns the live context window. With the
// star fallback above, any cross-origin page could read both bodies with a
// plain simple GET — no preflight, no header tricks. Protecting a heap dump
// four layers deep while leaving arguably more sensitive conversation content
// open to the identical attack was an inconsistency, not a deliberate scope
// choice, so isDebugPath below covers that prefix too.
//
// Why the /v1/debug/ endpoints get the CORS exclusion but NOT
// debugLoopbackOnly: unlike /debug/pprof, they have real browser consumers —
// the kernel serves its own dashboard at GET / and canvas at GET /canvas
// (serve.go), and both fetch /v1/debug/last and /v1/debug/context with
// `const API = window.location.origin`. Those are SAME-origin requests: the
// browser's same-origin policy lets the page read the response without any
// Access-Control-Allow-Origin header, so dropping CORS headers here costs
// those UIs nothing while fully closing the cross-origin read. Applying
// debugLoopbackOnly instead would break them outright — every dashboard fetch
// carries a Referer, which that guard rejects by design. Triggering these two
// endpoints cross-origin without being able to read the response is harmless
// because /v1/debug/last and /v1/debug/context specifically are GET-only,
// side-effect-free reads of an in-memory snapshot — which is why the
// no-cors/img vector debugLoopbackOnly exists to stop on /debug/pprof/profile
// (a 30s CPU burn) has no analogue here. That reasoning is about THESE TWO
// ROUTES, not about the tiers generally: do not carry it forward to
// corsLoopbackOnly, whose members are not all side-effect-free. See "What
// this tier does and does not do" below.
//
// Second exclusion tier — content and credential surfaces are loopback-only:
//
// #507's review rounds 4 and 5 found the identical read primitive on routes
// that are not named "debug" at all — first /v1/conversation (full
// untruncated turn text, session_id defaulting to the live session) and
// /v1/ledger (empty session_id means ALL sessions per LedgerQuery's doc
// comment), then /v1/cogdoc/read (raw workspace file content for any
// resolvable cog: URI). All are unauthenticated simple GETs, so the star
// fallback was enough for any page the operator happened to visit to
// fetch('http://127.0.0.1:6931/v1/ledger') and read the body. Round 5's
// response swept every registered route (the classification table below) and
// found the same class on more surfaces, including one credential leak:
// /v1/identity/grants/current returns a live grant's RAW TOKEN by design
// (the "zero-paste primitive" — its stated consumer is "a same-loopback
// page", which is exactly this tier's contract). As of ledger L03 that route
// is a POST behind the grant gate rather than an unauthenticated GET, so the
// CORS tier is now defense-in-depth on it rather than the only thing
// standing between a visited page and the node-root token; the tier
// assignment is unchanged.
//
// Tiered routes do NOT get the /v1/debug treatment of dropping CORS entirely,
// because they have legitimate CROSS-origin browser consumers on other
// loopback ports (the mod3 dashboard on :7860, the constellation surfaces).
// Dropping every Access-Control-* header would break them. What goes is only
// the "*" widening for non-loopback origins: corsLoopbackOnly echoes a
// loopback Origin exactly as before, and emits no Access-Control-Allow-Origin
// at all for anything else, so a remote page's fetch() still reaches the
// handler but the browser refuses to hand it the body. Same-origin clients
// (no Origin header) and non-browser clients (curl, the MCP CLI) are
// unaffected in either direction.
//
// # What this tier does and does not do
//
// corsLoopbackOnly closes cross-origin READ exposure and nothing else. This
// middleware never rejects a request; it only decides which Access-Control-*
// headers the RESPONSE carries. A remote page's fetch() still reaches the
// handler and the handler still runs to completion. What the withheld
// Access-Control-Allow-Origin removes is the browser's permission to hand
// that response body back to the calling page.
//
// For the read-only routes in the tier that is the whole story. It is NOT the
// whole story for the write-capable ones, and this file previously claimed
// otherwise ("these are side-effect-free reads" — false, corrected here). The
// tier is prefix-scoped, so it sweeps in every method under a prefix, and
// several of those prefixes carry mutations:
//
//	POST /mcp                      the entire MCP tool surface
//	POST /v1/chat/completions, /v1/messages, /v1/context/foveated
//	POST /v1/identity/grants       mints a credential
//	POST /v1/identity/verify, /v1/identity/grants/{id}/revoke
//	POST /v1/sessions/register, /v1/sessions/{id}/heartbeat|end|fork
//	POST /v1/bus/send, /v1/bus/open
//	POST /v1/handoffs/offer, /v1/handoffs/{id}/claim|complete
//	POST /v1/skills/{name}/exec    runs a skill
//	POST /v1/claude-code/spawn     spawns a subprocess
//	POST /v1/agents/{id}/tick|dispatch, /v1/agent/trigger
//	POST /v1/config/rollback
//
// Each of those decodes its body with json.NewDecoder(r.Body).Decode and
// requires no Content-Type and no custom header. A cross-origin page can
// therefore send a CORS-SIMPLE request — POST with Content-Type: text/plain
// carrying raw JSON — which triggers NO preflight, and the side effect
// executes. The attacker cannot read the response (that is what this tier
// fixed) but the write lands. That is CSRF, and this tier does not stop it.
//
// Two qualifications, neither of them a fix:
//
//   - PATCH /v1/config, PUT /v1/blocks/{hash} and DELETE /v1/bus/consumers/
//     are not reachable that way: PATCH/PUT/DELETE are not CORS-safelisted
//     methods, so the browser preflights them, and the preflight now fails
//     for a remote origin because this tier withholds Access-Control-Allow-
//     Origin on the OPTIONS response too. That falls out of the read fix; it
//     is not a CSRF defense, and it covers only the non-simple methods.
//   - The gap is not specific to this tier. corsMiddleware is the ENTIRE
//     middleware chain (`handler := corsMiddleware(mux)` in serve.go) — the
//     daemon has no auth layer — so the same simple-request write vector
//     applies to permissive POST routes as well (POST /v1/attention, POST
//     /v1/channel-sessions/register, ...).
//
// Write-side CSRF is a known, PRE-EXISTING gap, deliberately deferred rather
// than overlooked. It predates this change and affects routes this change did
// not create. Closing it means requiring something that forces a preflight on
// every write route — a custom X-Cogos-* header, or an Origin allow-list
// enforced as request rejection rather than as a response header. Either is a
// BREAKING change for every existing loopback client (the mod3 dashboard on
// :7860, the canvas, THESEUS), so it needs its own coordinated change with
// its own blast radius rather than riding along here.
//
// # Route classification table
//
// Every route the engine registers (serve.go's mux block plus every
// register*Routes sibling), classified by RESPONSE PAYLOAD — that is, by
// cross-origin read exposure. The classification says nothing about whether a
// route mutates state, and no tier here gates mutation; see "What this tier
// does and does not do" above. Audit coverage against GET /v1/manifest —
// s.route()-registered paths appear there. Classes:
//
//	NONE  — corsNone: middleware fully bypassed, no Access-Control-* ever
//	LOOP  — corsLoopbackOnly: loopback Origin echoed, no header otherwise.
//	        Blocks the cross-origin READ only; a mutating POST under one of
//	        these prefixes still executes (see the section above)
//	TELEM — corsPermissive, documented: telemetry/log/attention-score

// The dividing rule: a response that can carry document/conversation/agent
// CONTENT or a CREDENTIAL is LOOP; identifiers, paths, scores, and gauges
// are TELEM/META. The rule is about PAYLOAD CONTENTS, not route family —
// round 6 moved /v1/proprioceptive, /v1/traces, and /v1/kernel-log out of
// TELEM because their JSONL/log rows turned out to carry model-emitted
// tool-call arguments and prompt/query previews (writers cited in the table);
// "it's a telemetry endpoint" is never by itself a reason to stay permissive.
// The rule is also strictly about READ exposure: a route is not in LOOP
// because it mutates, and putting one there does not protect the mutation.
// Two maintenance notes: (1) routes registered by extensions
// (RegisterHTTPExtensions) or providers (providers_register.go) default to
// permissive — a content-bearing extension route must add its prefix to
// loopbackOnlyPrefixes; (2) new mux routes default to permissive, so
// classify them against this table when adding them.
