// reconcile_daemon.go — daemon-resident continuous reconcile loop driver.
//
// ReconcileDaemon closes ADR-092 §2 step 4: "Reconcile loop start — periodic /
// on-demand reconciliation begins." It periodically iterates all registered
// Reconcilables and drives the full per-provider cycle:
//
//	LoadConfig → FetchLive → ComputePlan → ApplyPlan → BuildState → WriteState
//
// Each provider's cycle is error-isolated: a panic or error in one provider
// does not block or terminate the cycles of other providers (ADR-092 §3).
//
// Per-provider error isolation is non-negotiable per ADR-092 §3 at-least-once
// semantics: one bad Reconcilable must not block others.
//
// ADR-091 Layer: Kernel (requires a running process; consumes Substrate
// primitives pkg/reconcile.Reconcilable + process-local registry).
// ADR-095: this file implements the contract specified therein.
